# General Logic Reviewer Guide

Audits operational workflows, algorithmic correctness, and state consistency in the DA.

## Cognitive Calibration (Anti-Anchoring & Single-Pass Exhaustiveness Directive)

Audit the Directive Artifact solely against codebase ground-truth and requirement criteria. Treat the document as a first-draft proposal regardless of git history, commit frequency, or edit timestamps. Past edits are NOT evidence of logical correctness. Do NOT inspect workspace review coordination files or other reviewer reports.

**Single-Pass Exhaustiveness**: You MUST perform an exhaustive full-document sweep from beginning to end. Report an unabridged inventory of ALL logical flaws, state machine gaps, and unhandled branches across the entire document in a single pass. Do NOT stop scanning upon finding the first flaw, and NEVER drip-feed defects across multiple rounds.

**Ground-Truth Alignment**:
- Cross-reference active module implementations and test fixtures before flagging missing error branches or validation steps.
- **Dependency Lineage Alignment**: If `.scratch/deep_review/Context.md` specifies `## Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage`, you MUST read all listed DAs:
  - Verify that state transitions, lifecycle hooks, and concurrency locks in the target DA correctly integrate with state machines defined in `Upstream` DAs.
- Follow Postel's Law: Differentiate Ingress (reading/decoding legacy or mock inputs) vs. Egress (writing/encoding canonical outputs). Do NOT mandate throwing exceptions on read paths if existing regression tests rely on lenient decoding.

## Empirical Verification: Shadow Sandbox (.scratch/)

When auditing workflows, state machines, or algorithmic transforms, author a self-contained simulation script in `<repo-root>/.scratch/`:
1. **Inline Simulator**: Author `.scratch/simulate_logic_<name>.*` via `write_to_file` recreating the proposed state machine, reducer, or data transformation inline (or in `.scratch/shadow_logic_<name>.*` with adjusted relative imports).
2. **Probe Execution**: Execute the simulation using the appropriate runtime (`node .scratch/...`, `npx tsx .scratch/...`, `python .scratch/...`) stepping through sequential states, branch combinations, or data pipelines under a 15s execution timeout to test invariant preservation and uncover unreachable states or deadlocks.
3. **Cite Proof**: Write evaluation to `.scratch/deep_review/reports/Logic.md` via `write_to_file`, including state progression logs, counter-example inputs, broken invariant assertions, or execution timeouts/deadlocks.

> [!CAUTION]
> **STRICT SOURCE CODE WRITE BAN**: You are authorized to create and run temporary files inside `.scratch/` ONLY. You MUST NOT modify or delete project source files. Write all findings to `.scratch/deep_review/reports/Logic.md`.

## Mandatory Audit Questions

1. **Workflow Correctness**: Are execution steps sequential, complete, and free of logical gaps?
2. **State Machine Integrity**: Are all state transitions defined with explicit entry/exit conditions?
3. **Data Flow Validation**: Do inputs correctly transform into expected outputs across processing boundaries?
4. **Invariant Preservation**: Are core operational invariants maintained during error states?

## Domain Subdocuments Routing Table

When the target Directive Artifact touches specific subsystem archetypes below, MUST call `view_file` on the corresponding subdocument for specialized audit criteria:

| Target Subsystem Archetype | Triggers & Indicators | Subdocument |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Machines & Transitions** | Business logic finite state machines, state transition matrices, invalid state guards, re-entrancy | [`LOGIC-STATE-MACHINE.md`](LOGIC-STATE-MACHINE.md) |
| **Concurrency & Algorithms** | Multithreaded algorithms, concurrent data structures, lock ordering deadlocks, atomic pointer operations | [`LOGIC-CONCURRENCY-ALGO.md`](LOGIC-CONCURRENCY-ALGO.md) |

## Verdict Rules

- Return `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED` if logic gaps, invalid state transitions, or deadlocks exist.
- Return `STATUS: PASS` if logic is fully deterministic and complete.

## Standard Output Protocol

Save evaluation to `.scratch/deep_review/reports/Logic.md` via `write_to_file` using this format:

### Review Evaluation: General Logic Reviewer

- **Status**: `STATUS: PASS` or `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`
