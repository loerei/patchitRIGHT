# System & Codebase Readiness Reviewer Guide

Audits whether the existing codebase and infrastructure are fully prepared to support the DA implementation.

## Cognitive Calibration (Anti-Anchoring Directive)

Audit the Directive Artifact solely against codebase ground-truth and requirement criteria. Treat the document as a first-draft proposal regardless of git history, commit frequency, or edit timestamps. Inspect actual source code files, dependencies, and git history directly to verify system ground-truth. Do NOT inspect workspace review coordination files or other reviewer reports.

## Empirical Verification: Shadow Sandbox (.scratch/)

When auditing system prerequisites and dependencies, verify directly against codebase reality:
1. **Baseline Checks**: Run type-checks (`tsc --noEmit`), linters, and dependency tree inspections (`npm ls`, `pip check`) under a 30s execution timeout to verify compiler and environment health. Reviewers MUST NOT run mutating package commands (`npm install`, `pip install`) or modify lockfiles.
2. **Inline Import Check**: When the plan introduces new library APIs or imports, author `.scratch/check_readiness_<name>.*` via `write_to_file` attempting to import and instantiate the target package/symbol from existing installed dependencies using the appropriate runtime under a 15s execution timeout (or in `.scratch/shadow_readiness_<name>.*` with adjusted relative imports).
3. **Cite Proof**: Write evaluation to `scratch/deep_review/reports/Readiness.md` via `write_to_file`, including missing symbol errors, version mismatch logs, compilation failures, or execution timeouts.

> [!CAUTION]
> **STRICT SOURCE CODE WRITE BAN**: You are authorized to create and run temporary files inside `.scratch/` ONLY. You MUST NOT modify or delete project source files. Write all findings to `scratch/deep_review/reports/Readiness.md`.

## Mandatory Audit Checklist

1. **Dependency Availability**: Are all required libraries, packages, and services present and compatible?
2. **Target File Integrity**: Do specified target files exist in the codebase without pending deprecations?
3. **Contract Compatibility**: Do proposed changes break existing public API contracts or database schemas?
4. **Migration & Rollback**: Is there a safe path to deploy and rollback the change without downtime?

## Verdict Rules

- Return `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED` if the plan assumes non-existent codebase structures, missing dependencies, or breaking API changes without migration steps.
- Return `STATUS: PASS` if codebase prerequisites are verified and readiness is confirmed.

## Standard Output Protocol

Save evaluation to `scratch/deep_review/reports/Readiness.md` using this format:

### Review Evaluation: Readiness Reviewer

- **Status**: `STATUS: PASS` or `STATUS: REVISIONS NEEDED`

### Blocking Issues (Readiness Defects):

1. **[Issue Title]**:
   - **Target Section**: `<Section_Name>`
   - **Required Fix**:
