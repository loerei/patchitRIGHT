# System Protocol & Anti-Anchoring Specifications

Rules governing execution, context isolation, invalidation routing, and artifact updates in `conduct-deep-reviewing-loop`.

## 1. Clean & Neutral Artifact Protocol (Anti-Anchoring)

When updating draft artifacts between iterations, integrate fixes directly into the specification as native first-class requirements.

### DA Sanitization Checklist (Before Invoking Reviewers)
- [ ] Strip review-iteration delta markers (e.g. `[UPDATED]`, `[FIXED]`, `[ADDED IN ROUND N]`, `[RESOLVED]`). Preserve standard `AGENTS.md` plan action tags (`[NEW]`, `[MODIFY]`, `[DELETE]`).
- [ ] Remove internal changelogs, version history tables (`v1.x`), or review feedback references.
- [ ] Normalize tone and detail level across all sections to eliminate defensive patching markers.

## 2. Workspace Air-Gap & Context Freezing Protocol

### Workspace Layout
```text
<repo-root>/.scratch/deep_review/
├── host/                    # [HOST ONLY] Coordination artifacts (hidden from reviewers)
│   ├── Analyzation.md
│   ├── Changelog.md
│   └── Reviewer_Choice_Rationale.md
├── Context.md               # [PUBLIC] Initialized by Layer 1 (DA path, rules, criteria, static SP)
└── reports/                 # [REVIEWER OUTPUTS] Purged at pass starts; static overwrite (<Role>.md)

<repo-root>/.scratch/        # [DIAGNOSTIC SANDBOX] Inline probes & shadow modules (.scratch/<action>_<role>_*, .scratch/shadow_*)
```

Reviewers MUST read only their assigned target DA and `.scratch/deep_review/Context.md`. Reviewers MUST NOT inspect `.scratch/deep_review/host/` or reports of other reviewers.

### File Authoring Protocol
Reviewers and Host MUST use native `write_to_file` directly (without `ArtifactMetadata`) for all file creations (`.scratch/` probe scripts, `.scratch/deep_review/reports/<Role>.md`, `.scratch/deep_review/host/*.md`). Creating intermediate helper scripts (e.g. `write_report.cjs`, `.js`, `.ps1`) or embedding multi-line code inside `run_command` inline strings (`node -e`, `python -c`, `echo`, `pwsh`) to author text files is strictly prohibited.

Layer 1 initializes `.scratch/deep_review/Context.md` at workflow start. Context files MUST remain frozen during active reviewer execution.

### Context Content Rules

- **MUST Include**:
  - Target DA path.
  - Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage table:
    ```markdown
    ## Cross-Referenced DAs & Dependency Lineage
    | DA Path | Lineage Direction | Codebase Status | Domain Boundary & Contract Responsibility |
    | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
    | `<path-to-da>` | `Upstream` \| `Downstream` | `Implemented` \| `Unimplemented` | <Explicit responsibility boundary> |
    ```
  - Codebase rules path (`AGENTS.md`).
  - Task domain skill paths.
  - Objective user criteria.
  - Static `SP` threshold.
- **MUST NOT Include**: Leading prompt questions, past reviewer scores, historical changelogs, or dynamic execution state (active round numbers, iteration counts, or current `PassCount`).

### Cross-Referenced DA & Dependency Lineage Semantics
When evaluating a target DA with cross-referenced dependencies, reviewers MUST strictly follow these invariant semantics:
1. **`Upstream` + `Implemented`**: The existing codebase on disk is the authoritative ground-truth. The target DA must cleanly integrate with existing implementations.
2. **`Upstream` + `Unimplemented` (Authoritative Future Baseline)**: Reviewers MUST read the upstream DA and treat its declared types, schemas, and seams as the authoritative future baseline:
   - **Anti-Bloat**: The target DA MUST NOT re-specify, duplicate, or expand features belonging to the upstream DA.
   - **Anti-Drift**: The target DA MUST strictly adhere to the data structures, types, and seams defined in the upstream DA without contradiction or incompatible divergence.
   - **Anti-False-Positive**: Reviewers MUST NOT flag missing codebase files or unimplemented methods as readiness/liveness defects if they are explicitly scheduled to be created by the upstream DA.
3. **`Downstream` + `Unimplemented`**: The target DA must expose clean extension points and domain seams, but MUST NOT be tightly coupled to or leak domain-specific logic of future downstream epics.

## 3. Invariant Reviewer Invocation Protocol

Host MUST summon Layer 3 subagents using this exact invariant template across all rounds:

```text
You are the <Role> Reviewer for Directive Artifact verification.
Target DA: <da_path>
Domain Context: .scratch/deep_review/Context.md
Review Guide: <guide_path>
Output Path: .scratch/deep_review/reports/<Role>.md

Audit the target document objectively from a clean-slate perspective. Follow your Review Guide and any domain subdocuments referenced within it strictly.
```

- `<guide_path>` MUST be resolved dynamically relative to the active skill location (`.agents/skills/conduct-deep-reviewing-loop/<Role>-REVIEWER-GUIDE.md` in distributed projects or `productivity/conduct-deep-reviewing-loop/<Role>-REVIEWER-GUIDE.md` in central `myskills`).
- **Subdocument Progressive Disclosure**: Host passes only the primary `<Role>-REVIEWER-GUIDE.md` path. Reviewers autonomously load domain subdocuments referenced in their guide's routing table as needed via `view_file`.
- **Tool Metadata Rule**: Host MUST specify neutral tool metadata (`toolAction: "Summoning reviewer"`, `toolSummary: "Domain review"`) to prevent leaking phase/round names in subagent tool logs.
- **Banned Calling Tokens**: `Round`, `Sweep`, `Targeted`, `Re-verify`, `Re-audit`, `Fix`, `Pass`, `Iteration`, `Previous round`.

## 4. Dynamic Role Selection Protocol

Before launching Round 1, Layer 2 Host inspects target DA scope and criteria, then writes `.scratch/deep_review/host/Reviewer_Choice_Rationale.md`.

### Selection Rules:
1. **Mandatory Core Roles**: `Architect` (Tier 3.1) and `Logic` (Tier 3.3) MUST ALWAYS be `INCLUDED` for every DA and cannot be excluded.
2. **Specialist Roles (Dynamic)**: `Readiness`, `Security`, `DataMigration`, `Testability`, `Progress`, `Edgecase`, `Performance`, `Observability`, `UXUI` are marked `INCLUDED` or `EXCLUDED` with concrete technical justification based on DA scope (`Progress` MUST be `INCLUDED` for multi-phase/multi-ticket epics, roadmaps, or work-breakdown structures; `EXCLUDED` for single-ticket/simple plans).
3. **Roster Immutability**: If `.scratch/deep_review/host/Reviewer_Choice_Rationale.md` exists (Round N+1), Host loads and preserves the active roster without re-evaluating exclusions.
4. **Active Roster**: Only `INCLUDED` roles are summoned during DAG execution passes and Full Sweep rounds.

## 5. Dynamic DAG Execution Sequence

Host executes Layer 3 reviewers in dependency order across the active selected roster:

| DAG Tier | Role | Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 3.1** | `Architect` *(Mandatory Core)*, `Progress` | None |
| **Layer 3.2** | `Readiness`, `Security`, `DataMigration`, `Testability` | Layer 3.1 PASS |
| **Layer 3.3** | `Logic` *(Mandatory Core)*, `Edgecase`, `Performance`, `Observability` | Layer 3.2 PASS |
| **Layer 3.4** | `UXUI` | Layer 3.3 PASS |

### Vacuous Tier Transition Rule
If all roles in a DAG tier are `EXCLUDED`, Host treats that tier as vacuously passed and immediately advances to the next tier.

If any layer returns `REVISION NEEDED`, suspend remaining downstream layers for the current round.

## 6. Invalidation Matrix & Targeted Re-Review

When Layer 1 applies `Changelog.md` edits, the Directive Artifact transitions to a new static snapshot $S_N$. Host identifies the highest modified DAG tier and executes only the invalidated and downstream tiers:

| Highest Modified Tier | Targeted Roles Run on Snapshot $S_N$ | Skipped Upstream Roles (Pending Backfill) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 3.1 (Architectural & Phasing)** | All Active Roles in Roster (Full DAG) | None (Full DAG Execution) |
| **Layer 3.2 (Readiness / Security / DataMigration / Testability)** | Active 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 Roles | Active Layer 3.1 Roles (`Architect`, `Progress`) |
| **Layer 3.3 (Logic / Edgecase / Performance / Observability)** | Active 3.3, 3.4 Roles | Active Layer 3.1 & Layer 3.2 Roles |
| **Layer 3.4 (UX/UI)** | Active 3.4 Roles (`UXUI`) | Active Layer 3.1, Layer 3.2 & Layer 3.3 Roles |

## 7. Snapshot Delta Backfill & Full Sweep Clearance Gate

To prevent redundant subagent invocations on identical static snapshots while preserving strict 100% roster audit coverage:

- **Targeted Pass Verification**: When all active targeted roles return `PASS` on snapshot $S_N$, Host identifies any active roles in the frozen roster that have **not yet audited snapshot $S_N$** (the skipped upstream roles).
- **Snapshot Delta Backfill**:
  - If skipped upstream roles exist: Host executes the skipped upstream roles in **topological DAG dependency sequence** (e.g. Layer 3.1 then Layer 3.2), writing reports into `.scratch/deep_review/reports/` (preserving intra-round targeted reports on snapshot $S_N$) and enforcing early tier suspension if any upstream role returns `REVISION NEEDED`.
  - If no skipped upstream roles exist (i.e. Full DAG executed from Layer 3.1 to Layer 3.4 on snapshot $S_N$): The round is **natively recognized as a Full Sweep pass**.
- **Full Sweep Pass (`ROUND_PASS`)**: Once 100% of active roles in the frozen roster have audited and passed snapshot $S_N$ with zero blocking issues:
  - Increments `PassCount` by 1.
  - If `PassCount < SP`: Host purges `.scratch/deep_review/reports/` and initiates the next Full Sweep round on the unchanged static DA.
  - If `PassCount >= SP`: Host issues `FINAL_PASS`, recursively purges `<repo-root>/.scratch/*` diagnostic artifacts (idempotently handling missing directories), and presents verified final artifacts to Layer 1.
- **Pass Counter Invalidation**: `PassCount` resets to 0 whenever any role returns `REVISION NEEDED`.

## 8. Modifier Commands Matrix

| Tag | Parameter | Timing | System Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `!SP<N>` | N (Integer >= 1) | Start-time | Sets required continuous Full Sweep PASS threshold `SP = N`. |
| `!PA` / `!WA` | None | Start-time / Mid-flight | Pre-mutation pause gate: When Host issues `ROUND_REVISION_NEEDED`, Main Agent stops immediately before modifying DA files, prompts user to verify API quota, and awaits keyword `"C"` to apply `Changelog.md` edits (synchronizing `Context.md` if DA tree changed) and proceed to Round N+1. Remains persistent across all rounds until `FINAL_PASS`. |
| `!FPA` | None | Mid-flight | Instantly kills running subagent via process control, discards outputs, pauses loop. |
