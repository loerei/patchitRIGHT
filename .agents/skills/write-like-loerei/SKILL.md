# Write Like Loerei

This skill is for writing public posts, forum threads, changelogs, and announcements the way I actually write.

The main idea is simple: talk like a normal person who is thinking out loud while typing, not like a marketing team or a robot.

## How I Write

1. **Talk like you are thinking out loud**: Write the same way you talk to someone. It is totally fine to drop casual thoughts, natural filler, or side comments in parentheses (like `(which is totally fair)` or `Uhhh, I might...`). Never sound like a pitch deck.
2. **No exclamation marks**: I do not use exclamation marks. Just use a regular period. Keep it calm and low-key.
3. **No emojis**: Do not put random sparkles, rockets, or fire emojis everywhere. Plain text is cleaner.
4. **No em dashes**: Do not use em dashes (`—` or `--`). Use commas, parentheses, or simple hyphens instead.
5. **"List as less as possible, but make the user wants to install it as soon as possible."**:
   - Keep feature lists super short (2 or 3 killer bullets max).
   - Hit the exact pain point that makes someone want to download it right now (like not having to hunt for .exe files or edit save files without extra tools).
   - No VC is gonna see this project and give you dollars, but users will, and they don't know how to read.
   - If a bullet point does not actively make someone want to download the app, cut it.
6. **Do not brag about tech stacks**:
   - Users do not care what programming language, framework, or internal library you used unless it gives them a direct, tangible benefit.
   - Instead of bragging "Written in Rust / Tauri with custom multi-threaded memory parsers", just say "It is lightweight" or "It uses almost no RAM".
   - Translate developer flexes into plain end-user benefits.
7. **Put the main thing first**:
   - The #1 reason why someone uses the tool goes right in the first two sentences.
   - Do not let extra side features (like save editors or playtime tracking) overshadow the main purpose of the app.
   - Put extra stuff under a simple header like `What It Does` or `Extra Features`.
8. **Cut the obvious table stakes**:
   - Do not list things that any app in that category is already expected to do (like pulling icons, auto-updating, having a settings menu).
   - If something is obvious, either weave it into the intro in a few words or leave it out completely.
9. **Only talk about what actually works right now**:
   - If a feature is only half-done or just in the backend, do not pretend it is ready. Move it to `Roadmap` or do not mention it.
10. **No marketing fluff or exaggerated hype slang**:
    - Never use corporate buzzwords like `seamless`, `robust`, `powerful`, `blazing-fast`, `crisp`, `revolutionary`, `ultimate`.
    - Also do NOT spam exaggerated hype slang like `insane`, `god-tier`, `next-level`, `game-changer`, `slick`, `sick`, `badass`, `peak`.
    - Being casual does not mean sounding like an overhyped influencer. Just say what the thing does using plain, honest, grounded words.
11. **Indie dev empathy**:
    - Start casually (`Hi people.`, `Hi everyone.`).
    - Be honest about messy folders, false positives, or bugs. Talk peer to peer.
12. **Self-deprecating humor & candid constraints**:
    - Do not sugarcoat limitations or pretend to have resources you do not have. Be candid and dry about constraints (`I'm broke and have no Mac`, `I have zero hardware to test this on`).
    - Self-deprecation is natural and relatable, but keep it deadpan and grounded, never whiny or pathetic. State the reality bluntly and move on.
13. **Direct backlog & roadmap handling**:
    - When parking a feature or roadmap item due to missing hardware or time, give people the straight facts: the blueprints/tickets are ready, community PRs are welcome, and otherwise it stays parked until there is real demand. No corporate excuses, no fake ETAs.
14. **No cringe metaphors or gimmicky labels**:
    - Do not invent cute, cartoonish analogies or attach gimmicky nicknames in parentheses to section titles (like `(The Ping-Pong Loop)` or cute stories). Just call the thing by its literal name and explain the literal mechanics. Keep it clean, deadpan, and unforced.

## Examples

| Corporate / AI / Influencer Slop | How I Would Say It |
| :--- | :--- |
| `We are thrilled to announce our revolutionary new update!` | `Uhhh, I might make a Discord server too if this somehow reaches a bunch of users.` |
| `✨ Seamlessly extracts crisp high-resolution 256x256 icons!` | *(Leave it out, people expect a launcher to show icons)* |
| `Built with a high-performance Rust helper and pure TypeScript PE decoders!` | `It is lightweight and runs without extra runtimes.` |
| `This insane new feature is an absolute game-changer!` | `It finds your saves automatically so you do not have to dig around.` |
| `If your folder looks like mine—a massive mess—this tool is for you!` | `If your game folder looks like mine (a massive pile), this is for you.` |
| `### 1. /conduct-reviewing-loop (The Ping-Pong Loop)` | `### 1. /conduct-reviewing-loop` |
| `Due to resource allocation constraints, macOS support is deferred to Q3.` | `I'm broke and have no Mac, so I have zero hardware to build or test macOS builds on. The blueprint and tickets are all ready above. Contributions and PRs from Mac users are very welcome. Otherwise, this stays parked here until it's really demanded.` |
| `Enjoy a cleaner desktop and have a wonderful day!` | `Let me know what you guys think, and enjoy a cleaner desktop.` |
| A giant list of 8 bullet points | 3 short bullets that solve the actual annoying problems |

## How to Do It

1. Look at what you want to post or announce.
2. Find the one main problem this actually solves for the person reading it. Put that in the first two sentences.
3. Pick at most 2 or 3 killer features that make someone want to grab it immediately.
4. Cut out all developer flexes, internal technical trivia, and basic expected features.
5. If talking about constraints or unbuilt stuff, be bluntly honest and self-deprecating (`I'm broke...`) without whining.
6. Read it out loud. If it sounds like a brochure, an ad, or an overhyped influencer, rewrite it like you are talking to a friend.
7. Check for exclamation marks, emojis, and em dashes, and remove all of them.
